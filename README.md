# PASS
 
All objects use DOTS. used both burst and jobs to get good performance.
Hade some trouble with playermovement script, enemy and spawner. the proplem with the scripts was that i wanted to make it so i didnt have to split the code between multiple scripts (mostly because i think its annoying) but encountered issues so many times trying to make it work i just gave up and made more scripts for it. 

W and S moves up and down
A and D rotates the player
Space to shoot
